-- Need to find out how proficient we are in solving critical tickets. How many business days are needed to solve a ticket?
-- (Need to Check for weekend, Holidays)

-- create database PracticeSQL;
Use PracticeSQL;
create table tickets
(
ticket_id varchar(10),
create_date date,
resolved_date date
);
--delete from tickets;
insert into tickets values
(1,'2022-08-01','2022-08-03')
,(2,'2022-08-01','2022-08-12')
,(3,'2022-08-01','2022-08-16');
create table holidays
(
holiday_date date
,reason varchar(100)
);
--delete from holidays;
insert into holidays values
('2022-08-11','Rakhi'),('2022-08-15','Independence day'),('2022-08-14','Public day');

-- SOLUTION:-
with cte as (
select ticket_id, create_date, resolved_date,count(holiday_date) as holidays
from tickets
left join holidays 
on holiday_date between create_date and resolved_date
and DATEPART(weekday, holiday_date) between 2 and 6
group by ticket_id, create_date, resolved_date
)
select ticket_id,
datediff(day, create_date, resolved_date)-2*DATEDIFF(week, create_date, resolved_date)-holidays as issue_resolve_time
from cte;

-- Extra Code:-
select *,
datediff(day, create_date, resolved_date) as date_diff,
DATEDIFF(week, create_date, resolved_date) as week_diff
from tickets
left join holidays 
on holiday_date between create_date and resolved_date;

select *
from holidays
where DATEPART(weekday, holiday_date) between 2 and 6;
